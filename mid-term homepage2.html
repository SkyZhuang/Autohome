<h1 class="text">The Jeep J6 Is the Regular-Cab Two-Door Gladiator Everyone Wants</h1>
<p class="text">With two doors, a six-foot bed, and cool detailing, the J6 looks ready to hit dealers.</p>
<p class="text">By: Todd Lassa April 7, 2019</p>
<p class="text">Who builds a new two-door anything these days? Sure, everyone will look at the Jeep J6 concept and shout “build it!” and the public will buy it . . . by the dozens. Except this is Jeep, a company that could sell sports cars to Italians and truthfully can sell just about anything to anybody as long as it really can go off-road. Jeep will remind you that covers everything it builds, including its 2019 Easter Safari concepts, which includes the J6, a two-door pickup truck with styling cues circa 1978 and production Jeep Performance Parts from Mopar.</p>

<p class="text">The bed is stretched by a foot over that of the new Gladiator, and now measures six feet. While the Gladiator borrows its rear suspension from the Ram 1500 pickup truck, the J6 is all Wrangler underneath, so it lacks the four-door pickup’s 7,650-pound tow rating. The two-door JL Wrangler has a 2,000-pound tow rating, while the Unlimited ups that to 3,500 pounds.</p>

<p class="text">The J8 shares the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited’s 118.4-inch wheelbase, and with the six-foot bed, it stretches to 201 inches in overall length, 34.2 longer than the two-door Wrangler. It’s powered by Jeep’s familiar 3.6-liter V-6 coupled to an eight-speed automatic. Additional goodies include a Jeep Performance Parts two-inch lift kit, Fox shocks, and 37-inch tires fitted to prototype 17-inch deep-dish beadlock wheels. The wheels are said to save four to six pounds each from the current beadlock option. The in-bed bar with spare carrier and front-bumper stinger bar are prototype parts for now, although the quartet of five-inch LED lights—cranking out 4,800 lumens apiece—are production accessories, as are the Jeep-logo latches used to hold down the Gladiator Rubicon hood.</p>

<p class="text">Designers chose the Metallic Brilliant Blue paint option from the 1978 Jeep Honcho, but “the original Brilliant Blue was kind of dull,” says Mopar design chief Joe Dehner. His team punched the color up and extended it to the spray-in bedliner. Jeep says the process to color-match the bedliner is no different than spraying in flat black, so look for more of this in the future. What’s really cool is the badging on the tailgate and front fenders; the “4-Wheel Drive” and “Jeep” plates are straight from ’78.</p>

<p class="text">Inside, the horn pad also is from ’78, while the instrument panel inserts are Brilliant Blue. Blue stitching also accents the Katzkin leather seats and armrests. There’s a bright pedal kit, all-weather floor mats, molded doorsill guards, a trailer-brake control switch, and a bank of auxiliary switches to operate the 10 total exterior LED lights. All in all, the J6 looks for all the world like a production model ready to roll off the lines in Toledo. So, yeah, we’ll go ahead and say it: Build it, Jeep!</p>
